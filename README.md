## Install
Download the `Darkside.itermcolors` and double-click it. (You may want to set it to standard in the profiles tab of your iTerm preferences.)

**A small side-node:** The bright colors are actually the normal ones with 20 % less saturation. If you want your bold colored text to be in the normal colors, uncheck `Draw bold text in bright colors` in you iTerm settings.
